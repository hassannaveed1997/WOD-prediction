It primarily targets the muscles of the posterior chain, including the lower back, glutes, and hamstrings. Proper form involves a neutral spine and a strong hip hinge.",
"back_squat": "The back squat is a lower body exercise where the lifter places a loaded barbell on their upper back and shoulders and performs a squatting motion. It targets the quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, and lower back. Proper form includes keeping the chest up, knees tracking over the toes, and achieving proper depth.",
"front_squat": "The front squat is a variation of the squat where the lifter places the barbell in front of the shoulders, resting on the front deltoids. It targets similar muscle groups as the back squat but places more emphasis on the quadriceps and core. Proper form involves maintaining an upright torso and keeping the elbows high.",
"overhead_squat": "The overhead squat is a challenging exercise where the lifter holds a barbell overhead while performing a full-depth squat. It requires a high degree of mobility, stability, and strength throughout the entire body. Proper form includes active shoulders, maintaining a stable core, and achieving full depth in the squat.",
"push_press": "The push press is a compound upper body exercise where the lifter uses leg drive to help press a barbell overhead. It involves a slight dip of the legs to generate momentum before driving the barbell upwards using the arms and shoulders. It primarily targets the shoulders, triceps, and upper chest.",
"push_jerk": "The push jerk is a dynamic movement where the lifter uses leg drive to propel a barbell overhead and then quickly drops into a partial squat to catch the barbell at full extension. It requires coordination, timing, and explosive power from the legs and upper body. It primarily targets the shoulders, triceps, and core.",
"split_jerk": "The split jerk is an Olympic weightlifting movement where the lifter drives a barbell overhead and then splits the legs into a staggered stance to catch the weight. It involves a powerful leg drive and quick footwork to achieve stability in the split position. It primarily targets the shoulders, triceps, and core.",
"thruster": "The thruster is a compound movement that combines a front squat with an overhead press in one fluid motion. The lifter starts with the barbell in the front rack position, performs a squat, and then explosively drives the barbell overhead. It targets multiple muscle groups, including the legs, shoulders, and core.",
"pull_up": "The pull-up is a bodyweight exercise where the lifter hangs from a bar with an overhand grip and pulls their body upwards until their chin clears the bar. It primarily targets the muscles of the back, shoulders, and arms, specifically the latissimus dorsi and biceps.",
"toes_to_bar": "Toes-to-bar is a gymnastic movement where the athlete hangs from a bar and lifts their feet up to touch the bar. It requires core strength, coordination, and flexibility. Proper form involves maintaining a tight body position and actively engaging the abdominals.",
"bar_muscle_up": "The bar muscle-up is an advanced gymnastic movement where the athlete starts below a bar, performs a kipping motion to generate momentum, and then transitions over the bar to a support position. It requires upper body strength, coordination, and timing.",
"ring_muscle_up": "The ring muscle-up is a challenging gymnastic movement where the athlete transitions from a hanging position below the rings to a support position above the rings. It requires significant upper body strength, coordination, and stability.",
"handstand_push_up": "The handstand push-up is a bodyweight exercise where the athlete performs a push-up movement while inverted in a handstand position. It targets the shoulders, triceps, and chest, as well as requiring core stability and balance.",
"pistol_squat": "The pistol squat is a unilateral lower body exercise where the athlete performs a squat on one leg while keeping the other leg extended in front. It requires strength, balance, and flexibility, primarily targeting the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings.",
"kipping_pull_up": "The kipping pull-up is a dynamic variation of the pull-up where the athlete uses a swinging motion to generate momentum and assist in pulling their body upwards. It requires coordination and timing, and it primarily targets the same muscles as the traditional pull-up.",
"ring_dip": "The ring dip is a gymnastic exercise where the athlete performs a dip motion on gymnastics rings. It targets the chest, triceps, and shoulders, as well as requiring stability and control to maintain proper form throughout the movement.",
"wall_walk": "The wall walk is a bodyweight exercise where the athlete starts in a plank position facing away from a wall, walks their hands towards the wall while walking their feet up the wall, and then walks their hands back towards the ground. It targets the shoulders, core, and stabilizer muscles.",
"wall_ball": "The wall ball is a functional exercise where the athlete performs a squat while holding a weighted ball (typically a medicine ball) and then explosively throws the ball upwards to a target on the wall. It targets the legs, core, shoulders, and arms, and it also improves coordination and cardiovascular endurance.",
"box_jump_over": "The box jump over is a plyometric exercise where the athlete jumps onto and over a box or platform from one side to the other. It requires explosive power, coordination, and agility. The movement targets the legs, particularly the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes.",
"lunges": "Lunges are a unilateral lower body exercise where the athlete steps forward, backward, or to the side while maintaining a stable torso and bending both knees to lower the body towards the ground. Lunges primarily target the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings, as well as improving balance and stability.",
"kettlebell_swing": "The kettlebell swing is a dynamic exercise where the athlete swings a kettlebell between their legs and then explosively drives it forward to shoulder height using hip and glute power. It targets the posterior chain, including the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back, and also improves grip strength and cardiovascular endurance.",
"burpee": "The burpee is a full-body exercise where the athlete starts in a standing position, drops to a push-up position, performs a push-up, jumps the feet forward towards the hands, and then jumps vertically with arms overhead. It targets multiple muscle groups, including the chest, shoulders, arms, core, and legs, and it provides a cardiovascular challenge.",
"double_under": "The double under is a jump rope exercise where the athlete rotates the jump rope twice under their feet for each jump. It requires coordination, timing, and rhythm, and it provides an intense cardiovascular workout while also improving agility and footwork.",
"box_jump": "The box jump is a plyometric exercise where the athlete jumps onto a box or platform from a standing position and then steps or jumps back down.
